The LDO 9T pinion on the motor from the Galileo 2 kit protrudes 1mm further from the stepper, interfering with the idler arm. 

This mod:
-Adds a recessed area with clearance for the pinion
-Enlarges the screw recess diameter to fit ULP screws
-Further recesses the screw hole for additional clearance (note: screw is now threaded threw less plastic on the rear side).

I used an ultra low profile scerw to hold the bearing, but a BHCS may fit.
